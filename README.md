# NucleiCounting

These scripts can be used to count nuclei in cells.

In the script for uninfected cells, users must draw around the cells before the script runs and counts nuclei.

In the script for infected cells, the script looks for staining in the viral channel to identify infected cells and then counts nuclei in those cells.
